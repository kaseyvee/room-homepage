### What I learned

This project really helped me to solidy the impact of CSS grid. The biggest challenge of this project was getting the arrow buttons container to align/overlap perfectly with the "About our furniture" div when viewing on desktops and wider screens. CSS grid did just the job in helping to achieve this.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to add a feature that automatically cycles through the hero items in a timed interval without clicking the arrows.
